# CollegeMajorvsCovid-Revisited

# About the project
## A simple analytical look at a psychology project for my Graduate Psychology program in 2021. 

<p> I believe that a college or university's top goal is to prepare students for their eventual place in their field of choice. Educators must adapt to new and changing job requirements and the knowledge needed to make an impact in the field. For cutting edge fields like medicine and STEM, this dedication to the implementation of emerging technology is paramount. The global pandemic of Covid-19 requires these cutting edge fields to prioritize the training of nurses, biologists, and medical field workers to new methods of stopping transmission and curing patients. My main questions are to see if students of various college majors have a difference in perceived importance of Covid-19 and its preventative measures and to see if there are any significant difference variances in their data. Would a history major have a higher perceived importance of Covid-19 vs a nursing major? Does the biological sex or college grade (Freshman-Graduate) of the student have any impact in their perceived importance of Covid-19?

This project collected anonymous data from students from Union College of various grade levels, biological sex, and college majors and tested to see if there was any relation to the students college major and their perceived importance of Covid-19. Besides the basic demographic questions, most questions asked to the students are based off of the Likert scale that spans from "strongly disagree", "disagree", "neither agree nor disagree", "agree", and "strongly agree" and a few additional questions that ask True/False, Yes/No responses.Â  The question inventory is a custom inventory created by the study's author as there are very few related question inventories at the time of this study's creation. </p>
